        <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>Hello, weary traveler. Welcome to my Capstone Website!</p>
          <p>In this website, I will be talking about and comparing my top three favorite video games. There are many different reasons why I enjoy certain games, and many reasons how I choose what game to play. I like playing games for relaxation and to unwind, but mostly I like playing games to win. There is nothing more satisfying than Unlocking those Achievements or getting those Victories!
          </p>

      <h3>TOP THREE GAMES</h3>
        <p>In no particular order, here are the games I reach for most often:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Call of Duty: Warzone</li>
            <li>The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt</li>
            <li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li>
          </ul>

        <p>These games are quite different from each other in gameplay but all share common traits such as adventure, fighting and figuring out puzzles.</p>
        <p>******Honorable Mentions: God of War, Final Fantasy Series and Super Mario RPG******</p>

      <h4>Breath of the Wild</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Storyline</li>
          <li>Gameplay</li>
          <li>Fighting</li>
        </ol>
          <p>The Legend of Zeldas 2017 re-incarnations of Link and Princess Zelda does not disappoint. The unique yet familiar storyline is engaging and has many quests each more entertaining than the last. The vast open-world of Hyrule and beyond is stunningly designed, with beautiful yet dangerous environments ranging from burning hot volcanic cities to deathly cold mountains. </p>
          <p>With an intermittent 60+ hours of gameplay I still have not achieved even 60% completion, but that's including the expansion pacs. The game increases in difficulty as the storyline progresses, and some of the expansion challenges are downright impossible. I could write about the perfection of the inventory lists and items for days! The amazing artwork alone deserves special recognition.</p>
          <p>This game was created with an effective focus on fighting styles and weaponry. With a new weapon system and a fully stocked armoury, this game has exceeded my expectations for a Zelda game. After 5 years, I still pick up and play this beautifully designed game even though it is not on my main console. I cannot wait for the release of Breath of the Wild 2, coming next spring.</p>

      <h5>The Witcher 3</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Monsters</li>
          <li>Fighting</li>
          <li>Storyline</li>
        </ol>
          <p>The Witcher Three is probably the most entertaining of the three games to play, it has imaginatively detailed creatures and epic battle sequences. The sheer number and array of enemies, both human and monster, present in this game is impressive. The fights are always fast paced and there is a multitude of powerful and special attacks. </p>
          <p>Geralts master swordsmanship is unmatched, with his double swords and magical powers derived from potions. He is a mutated human and posesses superhuman powers as well making fights that much more interesting. As he travels and picks up Monster Slaying Contracts or villager requests (usually a monster), he gains experience, new weapons and powers.</p>
          <p>The storyline for The Witcher is compelling, it is well-written and captivates the player to want to move on to the next quest or chapter to see what happens next. The choices you make influence your path and future quest availability.  </p>

      <h6>Call of Duty: Warzone</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>Gameplay</li>
          <li>Graphics</li>
          <li>Interactivity</li>
        </ol>

          <p>Warzone is an online free-to-play multiplayer battle royale video game set in a number of fictitious locations. There are daily challenges with XP Rewards, special blueprints, and Events throughout the year. There are consistent updates with new maps, new challenges and new rewards. The last challenge was Kong vs Godzilla and I missed the Event completion by probably 20k damage to godzilla. </p>
          <p>I really enjoy the details and layout of the game itself, the locations are diverse and the world is <em>huge</em>! There are condensed maps for the Multiplayer modes, and large maps for the Plunder, Resurgence and Battle Royales. One of my favorite things to do to waste time is admire the gardens and staging of the fake mansions. </p>
          <p>One of my favorite parts of playing this game is getting together with your squad and strategizing to win. There are some funny people playing online, and although you get the occasional troll there is always those players who make the game that much better. I love the fact I can play with my friends in different cities or right next door!</p>

          <h2>Comparison</h2>
            <p>As much as I enjoy these three games, it all depends on how I feel and how much uninterrupted time I will have available. Warzone really helps me to relax, which is funny because it isnt generally a relaxing game most days. The Witcher is more of a comfort game, much like a persons comfort show they will rewatch (even though I haven't actually finished the game). Breath of the Wild is at a difficult stage right now so when I feel like a quick challenge, I'll pop the cartridge in the switch and go.
            </p>
            <p>Although I could never pick an all time favorite, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> just hits that nostalgia meter hard.
            </p>
